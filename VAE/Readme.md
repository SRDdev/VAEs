# Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

Welcome to the Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) repository! This educational resource is dedicated to helping you understand and implement VAEs from scratch using PyTorch.

## What are Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)?

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a class of generative models that learn to encode and decode data in a probabilistic manner. They are neural network architectures consisting of an encoder and a decoder, trained to learn a latent space representation of input data. VAEs are particularly useful for tasks like generating new data samples or performing data compression.

### Key Components:

- **Encoder**: Takes input data and maps it to a latent space representation.
- **Decoder**: Reconstructs data samples from points in the latent space.
- **Latent Space**: A lower-dimensional space where data is represented.

## Mathematics behind VAEs

### Loss Function:

The training objective of a VAE involves maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO), which consists of two terms: reconstruction loss and KL divergence:

\[
\mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi; x) = -\mathbb{E}_{q_{\phi}(z|x)}[\log p_{\theta}(x|z)] + \text{KL}(q_{\phi}(z|x)||p(z))
\]

- **\(\mathcal{L}\)**: ELBO
- **\(\theta\)**: Parameters of the decoder
- **\(\phi\)**: Parameters of the encoder
- **\(x\)**: Input data
- **\(z\)**: Latent variable
- **\(q_{\phi}(z|x)\)**: Encoder distribution
- **\(p_{\theta}(x|z)\)**: Decoder distribution
- **\(p(z)\)**: Prior distribution on latent variables
- **\(\text{KL}\)**: Kullback-Leibler divergence
