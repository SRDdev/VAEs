# Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (ConvVAE)

## What is a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (ConvVAE)?

The Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (ConvVAE) is an extension of the traditional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that incorporates convolutional layers. It is particularly well-suited for processing and generating images, as convolutional layers are effective in capturing spatial patterns.

## How does a ConvVAE work?

The architecture of a ConvVAE is similar to that of a standard VAE, with the inclusion of convolutional layers in both the encoder and decoder parts. 

### Encoder:
The encoder in a ConvVAE takes an input image and processes it through a series of convolutional layers, downsampling the spatial dimensions while increasing the number of channels. The final output of the encoder is typically a set of parameters (mean and variance) representing the latent space distribution.

### Decoder:
The decoder reverses the process of the encoder by upsampling the latent representation and passing it through a series of convolutional transpose layers (also known as deconvolutional layers) to reconstruct the original input image.

### Training:
During training, the ConvVAE aims to minimize a loss function similar to that of the standard VAE, which consists of a reconstruction loss and a regularization term. However, in the case of ConvVAE, the reconstruction loss is often based on pixel-wise comparisons between the input and the reconstructed image.

### Sampling:
Once trained, the ConvVAE can generate new images by sampling from the distribution in the latent space and passing the samples through the decoder.

## How to Use:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VAEs.git
    cd ConvVAE
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Prepare Data:**
    Place your image dataset in the `data/` directory or use the provided datasets.

4. **Train the Model:**
    ```bash
    python train.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 64 --latent_dim 64
    ```

5. **Evaluate the Model:**
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py --num_samples 10
    ```
